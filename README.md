4.2	Process Model
•	Waterfall Model

The waterfall model is a cascading SDLC that depicts the development process as a flow, progressing sequentially through the phases of analysis, planning, realisation, testing, implementation, and support. This SDLC methodology entails a stage-by-stage execution of each stage. Waterfall methodology entails meticulous documentation. Each phase of this SDLC model has established characteristics.
The waterfall life cycle model is widely regarded as one of the most effective methods for managing complicated projects. This strategy enables the avoidance of numerous errors that occur because of poor control over the project. It does, however, result in widespread documentation development. It benefits future developers who work with the product, but it takes a long time to document everything.
 
If anything, material changes in the initial plan, the staff is wait till the very ends to restart and complete all software life cycle phases.
Fig.4.2.1 Waterfall Model


It will discover the benefits and drawbacks of the Waterfall SDLC methodology.
Benefits:
o	Easy to use and comprehend.
o	Management is simplified by the rigor of the process: each phase has a specified outcome and process assessment.
o	The stages of development proceed sequentially.
o	Ideal for modest to medium-sized projects with unambiguous needs It's simple to identify important aspects in the development cycle.
o	Simple job classification and prioritization.
Drawbacks:
o	Only after the final stage is completed is the software complete. High risks and ambiguity
o	Not recommended for complex, object-oriented projects Unsuitable for long-term projects
o	While the stage is still in production, it is difficult to gauge its progress.
o	Integration occurs at the conclusion, which eliminates the possibility of detecting the issue in advance.
Use cases for the Waterfall SDLC paradigm include the following:
o	The specifications are precise.
o	The definition of the product is stable.
o	Because the technology stack is predefined, it is not dynamic. No requirements that are ambiguous
o	The undertaking is brief.

•	Incremental Process Model
 
While the iterative paradigm is like the waterfall model, there are significant differences between them. As an example, imagine there is an app with ten essential functionalities. In the waterfall model, all 10 functions will be meticulously prepared during the requirement analysis and design phases and then implemented gradually throughout the development stage. Iterative models are distinct. This means that the entire phase is split into a fixed number of iterations, during which developers construct a fixed number of features.
As a result, the Iterative SDLC model does not necessitate a comprehensive list of requirements prior to the start of the project. The development process begins with requirements for the functional element, which can later be expanded. Because the process is repeatable, new versions of the product can be created for each cycle. Every iteration (which lasts two to six weeks) includes the development of a distinct system component. Following that, this component is added to the previously built features. In mathematical terms, the iterative model is a realisation of the sequential approximation method, which signifies a progressive approach to the desired final product shape.
During the first iteration, for example, the team has opted to focus on three features out of a total of ten. It is during the development of these that developers go through all stages of the software development process, from requirement collecting to deployment and maintenance. They must restart the development cycle whenever they move on to a new set of capabilities.
Fig4.2.2 Incremental Process Model


Benefits
o	Some functionalities can be swiftly produced at the beginning of the development lifecycle, while others must be developed later.
o	Parallel development is a technique that can be used. The progress is easily observable and quantifiable.
o	Shorter iterations result in easier testing and debugging stages, which saves time. Because high-risk tasks are performed first, it is easier to maintain risk control.
o	Problems and dangers identified in one iteration can be avoided in subsequent iterations by implementing preventative measures.
o	Flexibility and ability to respond to changes in demand are essential.

Drawbacks
o	More resources are required for the iterative model than for the waterfall model.
 
o	It is necessary to maintain constant management.
o	Architecture or design problems arise because of the short planning period in which not all requirements anticipated and addressed.
o	This is a poor choice for little tasks.
o	It is tough to keep track of the process.
o	Even at the end of the project's lifespan, it is possible that the risks will not be totally identified. The study of risks necessitates the participation of highly qualified individuals.

Use cases for the Interactive SDLC paradigm include the following.

o	Clearly defined specifications for the product are established from the outset. The project is vast and involves several difficult tasks.
o	Although the overall task has been set, the specifics of the work alter throughout the process.


•	Agile Process Model

Agile is a concept, not a development methodology. It encompasses an entire family of methods. Scrum, Kanban, and XP (extreme programming) are some of the more popular Agile SDLC implementations. Let's begin by examining the fundamental ideas of Agile in general, followed by a brief examination of some of its manifestations.
Its first distinction is that, like the iterative approach, all labour is divided into iterations. Sprints are used to refer to these iterations. The team begins by defining the actions that must be completed within a specified timeframe. The primary difference between this strategy and the iterative one is that the amount of work is not fixed and can be adjusted during the process.
The following distinction is that Agile never abandons clients. On the provider's side, specialists maintain continual communication with the client. They keep him informed of completed tasks and acquaint him with the plan. All adjustments are also discussed and approved with the customer. Before the development team can progress to the next step in Agile, each stage must be examined and approved by all stakeholders.
Agile methodology entails daily or weekly meetings and sprint reviews. Sprint reviews follow this format: the first half of the meeting is devoted to reviewing completed work, while the second half is devoted to preparing the next Sprint.
 
 

Fig4.2.3 Agile Process Model

Face-to-face communication is yet another part of the Agile software development life cycle. It is one of the Agile principles, which number twelve in total. Given the prevalence of outsourcing, meeting a customer face-to-face is difficult. Agile, on the other hand, uses video conferencing rather than audio conferences to allow for better understanding of body language. It aids in the prevention of some misconceptions and the development of stronger working relationships with clients.
There is much more that can be stated about Agile SDLC, but let's take a closer look at some specific data. The outcomes of research into Agile approach have been astounding. The following are the most important points:
The percentage of organizations using Agile has increased from 37 percent in 2020 to 86 percent in 2021. Agile results in a 50% increase in the number of business objectives achieved.
The ability to change project priorities at any time is cited as a primary reason for choosing Agile by 70% of respondents.
Sixty percent of programmers who work with Agile say they detect a significant reduction in time to market.
Benefits:
o	To enhance competitive advantage, modifications to functional requirements are incorporated into the development cycle.
o	The project is broken down into brief and clear iterations.
o	Risks are mitigated using a flexible change management strategy. Rapid release of the initial stage of the software
Drawbacks:
o	Because of permanent alterations, it is difficult to estimate the total cost at the end. The crew is very professional and focused on the needs of the client.
o	It is possible that new requirements will clash with the existing structure.
o	With all the modifications and changes, there is a chance that the project will take longer to complete than anticipated.
 
Conclusion: Researching and analysing the breadth of the project led to the conclusion that the incremental model is preferable to the others for building the software development life cycle, as it covers all bases and accommodates necessary adjustments.
